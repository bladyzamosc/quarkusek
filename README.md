# Quarkusek

## About 

This project was created to test couple of things from quarkus and latest java features. 
The inspiration for this was project/article of Piotr Minkowski, which you can find [here](https://piotrminkowski.com/2022/10/06/quarkus-with-java-virtual-threads/?utm_source=rss&utm_source=jvm-bloggers.com&utm_medium=rss&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=quarkus-with-java-virtual-threads&utm_campaign=jvm-bloggers).
I used a little different model and other tool for concurrent request generation.
